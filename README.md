# Scrimba The Fullstack Developer Path

**A monorepo containing all projects from the Scrimba Fullstack Developer Path â€” and showcasing my growth into a fullstack developer.**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned

- **Fundamentals of web development**: HTML5, CSS3, responsive layouts (Flexbox, Grid)  
- **Advanced JavaScript**: ES6+, event handling, DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming  
- **Frontend: React & Next.js**: SPA, SSR, component architecture, routing, state management  
- **Backend: Node.js & Express**: building REST APIs, middleware, authentication  
- **Databases**: SQL (PostgreSQL), Supabase, and vector databases for AI  
- **TypeScript**: type safety and tooling support in both frontend & backend  
- **AI engineering basics**: building AI agents, RAG, vector dbs â€” cutting-edge features :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **CLIs, deployment & CI**: using command line, deployment pipelines, and unified repo structure

## ðŸš€ The Project Collection

Each folder under `apps/` (or `apps-backend/`, `apps-fullstack/`) holds a standalone project:

- `project-01-fullstack-blog` â€“ Next.js frontend + Express backend + PostgreSQL  
- `project-02-supabase-auth` â€“ Auth with Supabase & full authentication flows  
- `project-03-ai-chat-agent` â€“ Simple AI agent using vector DB + local API  
*(â€¦more projects as you work through modules)*

Every project includes a README with **Tech Stack**, **What I Learned**, and **Demo/Screenshots**.
